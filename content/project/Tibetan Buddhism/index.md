“They tell us every day that we are stupid; they really believe that the ladies brain is smaller. Living here, when I see my monk friends from the big universities in south India, they are much better than us, it’s a fact. I don’t know if it’s about mental potential, or about conditions, or a mix, it’s difficult to understand. In our nunnery, we have many nuns who are not that bright because of these traditional rules and sometimes I doubt, since I’ve lived here, in the past I would have never said that girls are stupider than boys, but, ever since I’ve lived here, when I see Tibetan nuns versus Tibetan monks, they really look brighter.” 

A big theme in Buddhism is the concept of cause and effect. One’s actions, the good and bad karma he or she collects during this lifetime, will in turn affect the outcome of the next life. A collection of good karma will result in rebirth as an organism in an environment with little suffering, while bad karma could result in a rebirth in hell, as an animal, or an insect. A majority of the nuns live a life of doing dharma and collecting good karma in the hopes of being reborn as a male in the next life. (Mackenzie) The Tibetan word for nun itself “skye dman”, literally translates to “inferior birth”, and the Tibetan nuns themselves find this to be true. They believe that as females, they are automatically inferior because they have smaller minds, and smaller brains, and these are the reasons why they’re unable to achieve the same success as males. If ever there are nuns and monks in the same room, nuns are expected to sit behind the monks, lower their heads towards the monks in respect. They have to defer to the monk, and if there is any teaching to be done, the monk should always be asked first whether he would like to teach or not. Nuns are only allowed to touch their foods after the monk has taken a bite. 

The primary focus of this project was to investigate how gender differentiation manifests itself in the daily lives of Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns currently residing in monastic institutions in Nepal.

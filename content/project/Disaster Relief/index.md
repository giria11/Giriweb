Pregnant women are considered particularly vulnerable during natural disasters because they have special healthcare needs and are at an increased risk of pregnancy complications resulting from a negative change in environment. This study explored the experience of pregnant women in remote, rural settings immediately following the April and May 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. Staff from a locally-run INGO focused on maternal and neonatal health, One Heart World-Wide, conducted this study to assess: 1) key concerns among pregnant women immediately following the earthquakes,  2) resource allocation and access to health services, and 3) collaboration efforts among government, NGOs, and the community for earthquake response. Findings revealed that key concerns and immediate needs for pregnant women revolved around access to food and adequate shelter. In addition, although a cluster method approach was implemented by district health offices, there was an unequal distribution of earthquake relief resources and aid throughout the districts, likely related to challenges in communication and coordinating aid efforts between donor organizations and district- and community-level representatives.

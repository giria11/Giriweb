The Group Lifestyle BalanceTM Program was developed as part of the Diabetes Prevention Program by the University of Pittsburg and originally designed for overweight adults 18 years and older with pre-diabetes at risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, consists of multiple (weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly) sessions providing education and encouragement, as well as other tools necessary to help participants reach their own healthy lifestyle goals. 

The goal of the Teen Lifestyle Balance program as piloted by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute was to 1) adapt the curriculum from the evidence-based lifestyle intervention program, Group Lifestyle Balance, so that it could be used specifically with overweight and obese adolescent patients and 2) to identify the most effective method of delivering this new intervention to this patient population.

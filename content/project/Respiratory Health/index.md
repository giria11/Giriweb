Biomass fuel is burned organic material used for cooking, heating, and lighting by approximately 2.4 for billion people in developing countries. Although biomass is extremely inefficient, it is the only source of fuel that low income homes in developing countries can afford. The burning of biomass has been linked to an increased risk of respiratory infections along with various other problems with the lungs, heart, and eyes, because of the particulate matter it generates. The lack of proper ventilation has further exacerbated these risks. Because women typically spend more time cooking and doing various other activities in the kitchen than men in the kitchen, on average, woman are more likely than men to have respiratory problems. Women in socially marginalized groups are doubly disadvantaged.

This study 1) quantified the effects of smoke exposure from fireplace cooking on respiratory health and lung function in two different villages in rural Nepal, and 2) collected qualitative data on how social and economic variables limit choices of specific cooking technology and how that affects pulmonary health status.
